       "[67253    For President Donald Trump first year in office we are giving him a D. We chose this grade for a variety of reasons, According to \"They were bad he may be worse.\" by Micheal Gonchar, President Trump was the first president who failed to defend the nation from an attack on our democracy by a hostile foreign power, and to resist the investigation of that attack, he also threaten his defeated political opponent with imprisonment, and denigrated friendly countries and allies as well as a whole continent with racist vulgarities. Despite the bad, President trump has did something good he nominated many-well qualified conservative jurists to the appeals courts; but the quality of his district- court nominees appears to be significantly lower, so even though he's getting people hired they aren't qualified for the job. For all those reasons listed we give President Donald Trump a D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       " 67254    Giving this is trumps first year as president, We give him a C. He has the good intentions of being a great leader, he just needs to learn how to control his mouth sometime and also his twitter feed. He has done some great things so far as of passing some laws. We think he has a great vision for the United States and if he keeps doing like he is doing we will eventually see that vision come true. The tax cuts was probably one of the best things he did in his first year of office. The haters will hate just because of his name in general, they are going to down him even when he's doing good. So with that being said, We look forward to the future with trump as president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       " 67255         I would give Trump a +A because as a president he has done good things for our country. Many people would disagree with me because they like to compare Trump to other presidents, I believe that Trump has a vision for this country and many people are going to disagree with him because it isn't what they want to see being done to our country. In the essay \"What Makes a Great President,\" written by Karl Pove, Pove states \"Being a successful president means being a leader,\" I believe that Trump has stepped in and fulfilled the role of a leader. People may not see it but Donald Trump has been a leader to many people and he has built this country. Many may disagree because Trump wants to build a wall and get rid of the immigrants and he has ideas to release on the U.S. but that doesn't make him any less of a good president than any past president. If people didn't compare him to other presidents then maybe they would agree with me, Trump isn't a bad president, he just have different ways of approaching issues compared to our past presidents. My opinion on trump is like Albert Einstein's quote, \" Everybody is a Genius. But If You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid.\" I believe that if you truly look at Trump, the things he's done, and the ideas that he has for this country without comparing him to people that he is a great president; different, yes, but still a great president. \n",
       " 67256    We grade Donald Trump as a B. I never stopped fighting for the people and i have no intention of changing course. We put american's first, He enacted massive tax cuts, and tax reform for the american people, he created more than 2 billion jobs over the year american's has seen increase in their pay checks and retirement. American's are living in more safer, stronger, healthy and more secure.

       " 67257    In the article \"They were bad. He may be worse.\" Sean Wilente tells about Trump and what he thinks about him as a president. From reading this article we can support the grade we give Trump, a D. According to Sean \"Trump has been a colossal failure.\" and they measure his performance with the worst of the presidents. Trump has also failed to defend the nation from an attack on our democracy by a hostile foreign power and he resisted the investigation for that attack. He is very discrete and not open; and in a president we look for the opposite qualities of what he has.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       " 67258    I give Donald Trump a C for his first year in office. He has many qualities that contribute to a good president, but also has made poor choices as president. A good president is successful, and President Trump has been successful since before his presidency. The people are more confident in a president that has success so that they know the president is able to get things done for the sake of what's best for the country, In Karl Rove's article, \"what Makes a Good President,\" Rove expresses the importance of success by the president. \"A president who succeeds makes us feel that the nation can succeed, and it is also through the president's performance that we understand America's role in the world and America's hopes and aspirations for itself.\"(Paragraph 1) A good president is also honest and hardworking. While President Trump is known for being honest, sometimes a bit too honest, he lacks the qualities of a hard worker. Other presidents like FDR, Kennedy, and Bush started their first Hundred Days in office, but Trump spent his Hundred Days on vacation. Rove's article states, \"Effective presidents have a strategic vision and a direction in which they want to lead the country. They are concerned with big issues and big challenges, and seek to explain their vision in a way that allows people to understand.\"(Paragraph 5) I believe that thus was Trump's biggest flaw, his lack of hard work as president.                                           \n",
       " 67259    There is a multitude of qualities that someone must follow in order to reach a certain standard. When it comes to being the president of the United States, you should know the responsibility that comes with it. Our current president, Donald J. Trump, assured us he passed all of the categories with flying colors when he got elected into office back in 2016. He has done more bad than good, and the issues that were still evident when he went into the White House has been made worse. The grade Donald Trump would receive when it comes to his accomplishments and the promises he has kept, would be an F. He has failed to defend our nation from an attack on our democracy. According to the article, \"They Were Bad. He May Be Worse.,\" written and published by Sean Wilentz, describes the failures of past presidents and the failures of the former president. Although the analogy is very clear that Mr. Trump is making office worse, Wilentz states, \"Most important, he is the first president to fail to defend from an attack on our democracy by hostile foreign power - and to resist investigation of that attack.\" In other words, Trump is so busy trying to do things his was and switch up the old and better way of handling things in office, which is causing him to make promises he can't keep and say reckless things in the media to avoid answering the biggest question of them all; Is he becoming the reason why America is still having disputes with foreign allies?\n",
       " 67260         Based on evidence gathered throughout the president's first year in office, the grade given to him will be an F. Effective leaders must possess integrity, meaning that they are honest and have a strong moral code. Trump does not possess this quality. One of many lies told by the Trump White House during the first year is that Trump had the largest inauguration crowd in U.S. history, or that it was larger than President Obama's. This is not true, and while it may seem inconsequential it only goes to show the lengths Trump will go to to impress his constituents. Trump also lacks moral principles, as seen in his firing of former Attorney General Sally Yates. Yates was opposed to Trump's first travel ban; as a result, she was fired. A simple disagreement with Trump leads to the loss of a job. That seems more like a monarchy than a democratic government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       " 67261    President Trump would receive a C grade for his first year in office because he has made more bad decisions than good ones.  According to the article \"The year in Trump: Memorable Moments from the President's First Year in Office\" though the stock market continues to do well, job growth lags the rates under President Obama.  Even though he has improved some things, he has made other things worse. For example, Trump signed the first major tax cut in decades. However, he also has used twitter to have feuds with many people and organization which is not good behavior for a  president. He also withdrew from the Paris deal which will be harmful to the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

To us, he is not the greatest President in the world but he isn't the worst.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Also how much he uses Twitter, this shows that he is immature. President Trump is not all bad though, he does have good characteristics too.

President Trump is very stubborn and hard headed; these characteristics can be good or bad in a President but as we all know President Trump does not fold when put under pressure. As stated in Ryan Teague Beckwith's article \"Memorable moments from the presidents first year in office\" there were some things that I didn't understand or agree with like him firing so many people with reasons  unknown to the public. However his choice to bomb Syria was a great decision, not only did it show Syrian terrorists that we are not  playing but it showed them that the terrorists cant kill their own in the streets for no reason. President Trump also dropped a M.O.A.B on Isis targets in afghan. So no our president is not perfect and yes he has a very loud mouth but on the other hand our president is still trying to look out for us, and for that I think he deserves at least a B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       " 67279    For Trump first year in office, I give him a solid D. First, a president should make wise decisions. During Donald Trump's first year, he made several questionable decisions. For example, when he first got into presidency, Trump and former FBI director James Comey started off well. But that quickly went away when Comey was investigating Trump for possible ties with Russia,  but Trump immediately fired Comey. This was a very suspicious act. Also Trump fired Sally Yates, which was the attorney general, after she refused to defend the travel band. She argued that it was unconstitutional. I think its very questionable on why he fired the two people after they tried to argue there point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

This is a good improvement since more jobs are being created by the minute. The article also mentions that Trump has dialed back militarism, joining Russia in declining nuclear weapons. The recent tax cut that was signed December 22, 2017, has put money back into individuals pockets and hopefully boosting the economy. According the article \"President Trump: A year of real change\" by Washington Examiner, this change is being seen within the first year. Cutting down the 22 regulations and reforming the 30 year old tax code, people's paychecks have increased, education for K-12 funding has expanded, and child tax credit has doubled.

They avoid even the slightest imputation of corruption.

Also how much he uses Twitter, this shows that he is immature. President Trump is not all bad though, he does have good characteristics too. Like the fact that Isis has lost territory that they once controlled to us, this shows that what he is doing does have some good after products and that he sent most of his earnings to Puerto Rico after they were hit hard by Hurricane Irma. This is the reason we gave him a C, it is because we never really know what his next action will be and he seems to have a selective personality. This should not be a quality of a president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

President Trump is very stubborn and hard headed; these characteristics can be good or bad in a President but as we all know President Trump does not fold when put under pressure. As stated in Ryan Teague Beckwith's article \"Memorable moments from the presidents first year in office\" there were some things that I didn't understand or agree with like him firing so many people with reasons  unknown to the public. However his choice to bomb Syria was a great decision, not only did it show Syrian terrorists that we are not  playing but it showed them that the terrorists cant kill their own in the streets for no reason. President Trump also dropped a M.O.A.B on Isis targets in afghan. So no our president is not perfect and yes he has a very loud mouth but on the other hand our president is still trying to look out for us, and for that I think he deserves at least a B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

For example, when he first got into presidency, Trump and former FBI director James Comey started off well. But that quickly went away when Comey was investigating Trump for possible ties with Russia,  but Trump immediately fired Comey. This was a very suspicious act. Also Trump fired Sally Yates, which was the attorney general, after she refused to defend the travel band. She argued that it was unconstitutional. I think its very questionable on why he fired the two people after they tried to argue there point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

This is a good improvement since more jobs are being created by the minute. The article also mentions that Trump has dialed back militarism, joining Russia in declining nuclear weapons. The recent tax cut that was signed December 22, 2017, has put money back into individuals pockets and hopefully boosting the economy. According the article \"President Trump: A year of real change\" by Washington Examiner, this change is being seen within the first year. Cutting down the 22 regulations and reforming the 30 year old tax code, people's paychecks have increased, education for K-12 funding has expanded, and child tax credit has doubled. This is seen as a huge step forward for bringing the economy up. However, not all good is observed in Trump's presidency.

Trump then launched a \"missile strike in response to a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people\".

Trump lacks in the area, handling the situation on entirely new level. Continuous tweets about the country and threats were made from Trump himself. Trump has focused a great deal on immigration in the first year, dropping the number of people immigrating into the country and focusing on enforcement for illegals crossing into the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       " 68802    I give Donald Trump a D for his first year in office. An important quality of a leader is honesty. Honesty creates a stronger bond of trust between citizens and a leader. This allows for an effective flow in government. On December 29 2017, Mr. Trump tweeted that his approval rate \"was approximately the same as President Obama\" who's approval rate was 47%. He claims that despite extensive \"negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax\" he has reached the approval rate of former President Obama, somewhat insinuating that the rate could have been higher. But his claim is easily contradicted b a Gallup approval rating report. In \"Trump's First-Year Job Approval Worst by 10 Points\" from \"news.gallop.com\" penned by Jeffery M. Jones states that Trump's approval rate \"averaged 38.4% during his first year in office.\" Mr. Trump claimed that to his twitter followers that his approval rate was roughly 9% higher than it actually was. Mr. Trump now holds the title for lowest first year approval rating. By lying about his approval rate pushes people to doubt almost everything he says. Honesty is a quality that results in an effective leadership but it is a skill that Mr. Trump lacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       " 68803    President Trump first year in office has been very different. Every president has had their very own special way of making things happen in the White House, but Trump has kind of change the path. I believe he has had to many verbal dispute with the public and not handling busy in the oval office. A president should not communicate on Twitter as President Trump has done and still doing, the president should carry himself in a very mature manner when deal with the public. I would rate his president performance as a very high \"D\". He has to work a little more on his performance and presenting himself in a more president fashion.

       "[74491    I am the person who will cry at the death of a dog in a movie while the death of a person in said movie leaves me unfazed. I think the reason why I find myself more sympathetic towards the welfare of animals is because in my eyes they have no voice and this innocence about them. But in no way does that mean that Iâd be able to choose the welfare of an animal over the welfare of a human. There is no authority that gives us the right to make the decision that our lives are more valuable than that of a dog, gorilla, cow, lion, etc. so there should be no reason why we should treat them as anything less than ourselves. And on that note there is no reason why we should only uphold the lives of certain animals when without all the creatures of the world there would be no ecosystem to support our society.<br/>Instead of focusing on just animal welfare or just human welfare we should focus on helping both since their welfareâs are dependent on each other in most areas of the world. As said by Kristof, âone of the most important resources some poor countries have is wildlifeâ. The World Wildlife Fund is one of the many organizations that employs the locals to help track gorillas or serve as rangers on the reserve, jobs that benefit the people and the animals involved. Because in the end âWhatâs good for the animals is also good for the Pygmies,â. We are living on the same Earth together, we need to support the welfare of all creatures on it.                                                  \n",
       " 74492    I want to just start by saying that yes I along with 40% of people surveyed would save my dog over a foreign tourist. That may sound very harsh, but I feel a much stronger connection to my dog than I do most people. This isnt to say I wouldn't save the tourist if I could, but my dog is so special to me that it would be devastating if I ever lose him. <br/><br/>Do I agree with helping some gorillas in a forest while letting people die from something easily preventable no I don't as no one should. We should be fair and balanced with helping humans and animals. This though is easier said than done as the article states \"the petition for Cecil the lion was greater than for Tamir Rice.\" This is in my opinion because as I talked about with my dog, my connection to animals and things that I find \"cute\" I tend to feel more passionately about. <br/><br/>Whenever the ASPCA commercials with the poor abused dogs come on I feel physical sadness and have to look away, whereas you see on tghe news another person was murdered and don't even flinch. In many ways I think this also goes back to how it feels like preying on the weak in this case animals that cant fight back to someone beating them and making them dogfight or such. I personally will attempt to be better about feeling more compassionate for people just as much as animals.                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       " 74493    I donât understand how anyone can think there is a one or the other in this debate. Why must one species be denied of their rights for the other to have it?<br/>    In the article, it states that there were more signature on a petition for the shooting of Cecil the lion than the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Itâs not that people care more about animals lives than they do humans. Many people view animals as small, and without a voice, so who else to speak up for them but us? The problem with this is that we tend to forget our fellow humans. The people we interact with and see everyday.<br/>    Although we shouldnât forget about animals, we need to also keep humans in our mind. Just because each person has their own voice, does not mean they donât need others to speak up for them. Just because animals donât have the same size brain or opposable thumbs, does not mean their lives are any less precious than ours. There should be absolutely no debate for one or the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       " 74494    Is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering?<br/>I don't believe that it's necessarily âwrong âor that this even is a right or wrong situation, more so that it's easier to have sympathy for animals because they are such innocent creatures. There has been a multitude of times when I have watched a movie, and I told myself that as long as the dog or animal doesn't die, then I will be fine. However, in reality, I would never actually chose an animal over a human being. An example of this that was discussed in the article was when there was a huge discrepancy between a lion getting shot (which produced a large amount of outrage) and then a 12 year old boy getting shot by a police officer. Cecil the Lion attracted far more attention and complaints than the shooting of Tamir Rice which I find absolutely ridiculous. Overall, no one should feel guilty for focusing more on animal cruelty than human suffering, but there should definitely be a balance between the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       " 74495    It's a tough question to ask of people. I can't say that I'm \"more dedicated\" to helping people or animals, because there's no realistic scenario I can think of that would force me to choose between them. However, as distinctions between social classes increase and people become more uneducated about global issues, there is definitely a disconnect between more privileged people and humans that are suffering due to social inequities, poverty, and catastrophes in other parts of the world. As mentioned in the article, more enraged petitioners vied for the protection of a lion than Tamir Rice, an innocent black child who was unfairly targeted by a white policeman (among many other victims of police brutality fueled by racism). And more people pay out of pocket to try and save endangered species than speak up about the recent airstrikes on Syria, where unprotected civilians have been paying the brutal price for a crime they didn't commit for years. However, that doesn't make fighting for animal rights wrong; it just demonstrates ignorance of social issues. Mr. Kristof says, \"Compassion for other species can also nurture compassion for fellow humans.\" Conservation efforts for endangered species can also benefit third world communities, such as in the Dzanga Sangha Protected Area, where the World Wildlife Fund also supports jobs, health, and education of locals. There is no obligation to choose between humans and animals, but we should be sensitive to the welfare of both.                              \n",
       " 74496    Throughout time, I have noticed that in occasions I would rather dogs to humans. I believe many people feel more concerned when it comes to animals due to us noticing them as helpless little creatures. During movies, I see people get hurt or die and it doesnât bother but if a animal dies or anything like that then I will start to ball my eyes out. Human suffering is just as important as mistreating animals.<br/>I have a dog now and am about to get another in June. Considering my pets as family is something I take part in. This is why we should treat wild animals and pets just as we do humans. If you truly think about it, animals provide a lot; labor, food, and care. Throughout the article Dieudonne Kembe says, âWhatâs good for the animals is good for the people.â This statement means that as long as you help the animals it will benefit you. Even if you do the smallest things, for example, giving to a charity, or helping out at a shelter for a while. Maybe this will lead to you getting your own pet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       " 74497    While donating to a charity for a good cause is empathetic (regardless if itâs for humans or animals), some charities are simply more empathic than others. Human lives should matter more than an animalâs and should receive priority in the publicâs eyes, but charities that support both are the most empathetic and the wisest choices for donation (such as The World Wildlife Fund). By helping both humans and animals, the donor would never feel guilt over having to choose one or the other to aid.<br/><br/>When you donate money to a human charity for a poorer country, you meet their needs for whatever they require at the present time (ex: mosquito nets) and while this is extremely helpful, itâs inevitable they will have other needs in the unforeseeable future. Charities that support someoneâs way of life, create jobs or teaches people valuable skills offer the opportunity to make more money and the ability to purchase more of what individuals need for themselves and their family, without further aid from an organization. This is sustainable and is more empathetic than charities that give aid through private hiring from their origin country that only have the ability to help either humans or animals. In this way, local people who are in need of a job are given a chance to obtain one along with the opportunity to help their own communities (through educational or medical programs) and protect and conserve their land and home.                                                                    \n",

One is, \"I will choose this.\" A second option is \"I will choose that.\" Many people don't see the other two options, however: \"I will choose neither,\" and \"I will choose both.\"<br/>In the case of choosing animals over people, many feel as though they must choose one or the other, but instead of pitting animals vs. humans, I, for one, choose both. Instead of treating animals worse to show your devotion to humans, I think we should rise up and treat humans as we do animals (because after all, humans are animals too).<br/>A lot of people support animals because they feel as though they are of lesser power and lesser control than humans. They are inferior to humans, and our nature is to help those who are lower than us.<br/>It is definitely not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Instead, we should hold ourselves to the same standards we do animals. Animal welfare should be just as important to us as human welfare.<br/>I agree with Mr. Kristof in that \"empathy isn't a zero-sum game.\" We can empathize both animals and humans at the same time, and it shouldn't be one or the other. And it's not that we only empathize animals and not humans. We as students protested for the lives of the 17 victims that were taken too soon by a gunman. The problem is that there are a lot more human tragedies than animal tragedies, and sometimes it comes with less guilt to focus on the latter.                             \n",

In my eyes theyâre as equally as important, humans and animals are both always going to require help in their life.<br/> I personally believe itâs because us as humans we have the ability to defend ourselves. While animals donât really have that ability. People also tend to build a very emotional connection with animals. We feel that itâs our jobs to protect them since they canât do much for themselves. I donât certainly believe itâs wrong, but I think that humans they should both have attention. To me animals seem to be praised at such a high level, when theyâre killed by the fault of a human they receive so much attention, but itâs not always the same for people. Roxane Gay tweeted âIâm personally going to start wearing a lion costume when I leave my house so if I get shot, people will care.â Thatâs a lot to take in itâs showing how people are starting to feel that their worth is not valued. The study showed how 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist. I understand giving them attention, like for example the last white rhino who had recently died in Kenya for  Chinaâs wants, but when a tragedy happens that involves a person, they should receive the same amount of attention since itâs still a life that matters.                                                                                 \n",
       " 74500    I believe that when it comes to choosing between humans and animals that most people would choose an animals welfare over that of their fellow humans.  I think this is because most people have strong connections to their pets and when they think of animals it reminds them of their own pets.  However to answer the question I believe that while animal welfare is rightly important that humans need it more than animals at least in certain scenarios.  So unless a species is on the verge of extinction or near to it then I believe that money could go into better furthering human needs.<br/><br/>Nicholas Kristof says that he âsometimes feel uneasy. I wonder: Does honoring animal rights come at the expense of human rights?â.  In my opinion many will feel the same because at what point do we draw the line at deciding where badly needed money goes; to those in need, or to the animals.  However the otherside would stress that not enough is being done to protect valuable species that face extinction because of humanity.  I Am in favor of better laws protecting these endangered species but allocating large funds for these animals seems implausible as many humans all over the Earth face their own various  forms of extinction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       " 74501    I don't think it's a matter of people putting animal welfare above human welfare. People, including myself, are just more inclined to help the animal getting beat with a bat because they can't really help themselves. Humans might not have an easy time defending themselves against a bat either but they can still do more than a dog would be able to. Also, there are many more organizations to help suffering people than there is to help suffering animals so I don't think it's wrong if people want to focus on animal welfare. Furthermore, I agree with Mr. Kristof's statement, we shouldn't compare sympathy for different species. Like I said before, it's not about caring more about one more than the other it's more about trying to protect the much smaller, defenseless party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       " 74502    I think as people, we should care greatly about saving fellow humans. However, animals are also very important in society. There are definitely a lot of people out there who do not really enjoy being a human, and so many of them also have little sympathy towards people. It is definitely very upsetting to see a suffering or dead animals, maybe because a lot of people see them as mostly defenseless creatures, but so are little kids, and they face a lot of danger every day. Of course, now, people are starting to fight for certain safety issues affecting children, but a lot of voices are being ignored. When Harambe was killed in 2016, people were livid. Some went so far as to even vote for him in the presidential election a few months later. It is a known fact that people tend to blow up over some of the smallest things, but they also get very picky about what is controversial in importance. A lot of people were angry about Harambe being killed, and they even blamed the kid and his parents for him also falling into the gorilla area. There were not enough people on the internet wondering whether the kid was okay- I'm not even an excuse because I jumped onto the meme with all my friends because we thought a child \"causing\" a gorilla to be shot was funny. Overall, I think it is best that we focus on both animals and humans. We should not favor one species over the other, because in the long run, animals do a lot for us, but we still need to respect our fellow people.                                   \n",

That being said, I think responses to violence against humans are subdued compared to violence against animals, and Roxane Gayâs statement, âIâm personally going to start wearing a lion costume when I leave my house so if I get shot, people will care,â has a lot of resonance in the wake of the recents shootings of unarmed black men in the United States as they cycle in and out of the news. There is certainly plenty of room for empathy surrounding human rights issues, but itâs not wrong to care about animal rights as well. More than anything I believe we should all try to not just have compassion, but turn that compassion into action, as sympathy alone is not what will make the change we want to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       " 74504    This is an extremely debatable topic depending on how it is seen. It is not wrong to focus on animal welfare because they are very different from humans. Although humans need help as well, humans are responsible for the way other humans are being treated and their welfare. However, we should focus on animal welfare because the most common reason they need help is because of our actions. We kick them out of their homes and use them for our benefit when they were previously living fine before.

       " 74505    To say that an animal or human is more important than the other only further implies the injustice within our system. In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare, as we should care about beings other than ourselves; however, we should not put aside our brotherhood altogether as the safety and well-being of our fellow human is just as important.  Those who feel differently typically do so because they believe that we are the reason for an animal's distress, which, is technically true. However, just because we humans have idiotic tendencies, this does not mean that we abandon our own. Who are we to determine the importance of who lives and who dies? We are all a part of this Earth.

In all honesty, I think the reason for that is because humans do not get along with other humans. Humans have emotions that are unexplainable and also do actions that are unexplainable, while animals are here just being themselves, doing what they need to do. Animals have a reason for everything while humans do things âjust because.â Also, we are not interested in humans as much because we are surrounded by them every minute of every day whether itâs through a screen or in person. We see people suffering all the time on the streets and in other countries but do nothing to help because we have become so familiar with seeing that. Seeing that all the time does not have an impact on us anymore.

I too, fall into the majority of this study, and have always had a soft spot for animals.  When I was little, I used to imagine that I would become a well known veterinarian that would help animals all over the world. In the article, Kristoff writes about how the shooting of a lion located in Zimbabwe attracted more outrage than the shooting of a 12 year old by a Cleveland police officer. It is ironic how humans care more about animals than other humans.<br/>\\tAnimals are beautiful creatures that were created with less abilities than humans. People care more about animals because they were not created with evil intentions. Humans are unpredictable and some have bad intentions. We donât think of animals as evil. To us, they are harmless creatures and if they attack us, it is in their nature. Animals can take care of themselves in the wild, but if they are captured, they do not know how to protect themselves. My family has not supported circuses just for this reason. The circus has a reputation of abusing the animals, and it is not right for them to be taken from their homes to be obedient. We have animals as pets and love them like our own. Kristoff was correct. Humans have the tendency to feel more sympathetic towards animals because they are unique, special creatures and need our help to be saved.                                                            \n",
       " 74509    The reason why so many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals rather than humans is because animals cannot help themselves or does not have as much of an ability to change a drastic situation when compared to humans. Humans have an ability to talk and to think independently and act on their own so people view other humans having that ability to help themselves. Animals can't take care of themselves like humans can. For example, in Kristof's example of when an animal is being beat up by a bat, most dogs can't fight back or oppose that abuse; they cannot call for help nor they can say anything back. Humans, on the other hand, have that ability to effectively oppose such abuses and to change such conditions. It solely is due to the ability of each species to protect themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       " 74510    It is not wrong to focus on animal welfare. Neither the well-being of animals or humans are to be placed or ranked higher than the other. In agreement with Kristofâs  Point, caring for animals may create compassion for other humans. Both humans and animals are mammals, we inhabit the same earth. Keeping each other safe and respecting one another is needed for more peaceful society.<br/>The one to judge the person in the theoretical scenario who saved their pet over a tourist negatively, would be the person with a selfish mindset that human life trumps animal life. All lives are equal. Yes, one should save another human life. No, one should not ignore the life of an animal. Let us not judge one another over a scenario that is not real. It was made up, and is unrealistic to hold the answer to value of life within a theoretical event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       " 74511     When comparing humans and other animals, one thing becomes apparent: humans are especially vile. Never has an animal so deliberately devastated an environment for personal gain nor exterminated entire populations (even some of its own) based on superstition such as racism or sexuality. This is important in finding why humans care more for animals than their own kind as humans have other interests, mainly profit, that will trample over others of their own species. Humanityâs role as the âdominant life formâ also gives it a âcallingâ to defend âlesser beingsâ, we can see this in politics; the U.S. defends weaker nations like Israel and South Korea (some would even say it does this while neglecting its own people) despite the very few unique benefits they would bring. Animal welfare opens the door for human welfare; itâs not uncommon for breakthroughs in animal treatment to make its way into the treatment of people (the Animal Welfare act of 1966 gave ethical guidelines for the testing of subjects and in the â70s push for ethical treatment of human subjects became common).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Animals do not deserve to be in a scenario where they could be hurt because they do not know any better, unlike humans. An animal should never be in the situation of getting beat by a bat, as hypothetically proposed by the article, but a human made choices that led them to that situation.

       " 74514    Many people are more empathetic to animals who are unable to speak and properly communicate with them, than they are to other people. But showing more empathy to those of another species doesnât qualify someone as sociopathic or cruel, it is actually quite rational. As people we witness the evils of other people; murder, terrorism, violence. So, itâs understandable that one could feel little emotion upon hearing that a member of our species is suffering. Animals, on the other hand, very rarely commit atrocities with malicious intent. In fact, any âwrongdoingsâ of animals are typically motivated by a feeling of obligation to protect their fellows. Generally, animals are more compassionate and kinder-spirited than humans. Therefore it makes sense that some people are more reactive to the pain of a dog who bites in order to protect its puppies, than they are towards a human whose great grandfather probably bought people to use as slaves. So a better question might be: why are people more empathetic to the pain of Sadie the Sock-Chewer than they are to the pain of Randy the Rapist?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       " 74515    I am more dedicated to helping humans more than animals. I say this because  humans are merely animals that possess common sense, which is something we need in this world. We can help humans help animals by educating them on hunting regulation and the importance of the animals to our world and its food chain.  Our main focus should be to help humans that suffering especially in countries like Nigeria, Libya, and Afganistan. These three countries and many more are among those facing terrorism, human-trafficking, and even slavery. I  believe that the lives of the people in these countries are far more important. AS I said before, animals serve a purpose in the food chain, but even if the food chain was to be so extremely affceted that ut would lead to world hunger, it is still possible for scientists to synthesize food. I think that people are more empathetic towards animals because they are more aware of the suffering that animals face. This is most likely because you usually see more about the peril that animals are in on the media. So in my opinion, I do think it would be wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because even though animals are cute and adorable, there are children all over the world that are starving. I disagree with her statement for that same reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

I feel guilty about animals, because they were doing just fine before humans came and interfered. The reason animals need protection and help is because of humans.

People are more empathetic towards animals because they are cute, furry, and entirely innocent. It isn't their actions that put the animals in danger, but ours. I don't believe it is wrong to help animals, many animals would be extinct by now if it weren't for human intervention, and many ecosystems would be off-balance, which would affect human-life as well. It is wrong, however, to focus primarily on animals. There are people all around the world who are starving, and in constant danger, but many people prefer to look at the cute puppies. That is wrong, and I agree with Mr. Kristoff. The world is a dangerous place full of people in animals who need our help, and helping anything is a good thing. It is wrong to call someone out for donating money to a dog shelter, because they are doing a good thing. It is also wrong to ignore the people in countries not as privileged as our own, who can't even afford children's healthcare. Our world is filled with problems, and helping animals or people helps rid the world of some, no matter what exact problem you choose to deal with.                    \n",

Yes, animals are going extinct but most extinction and endangerment of animals is caused by human interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       " 74519    I feel people empathize with animals more than humans due to many reasons. Maybe it is due to them reconciling what they see to a pet from childhood or one they currently have, or something theyâve seen. In another situation, I also believe itâs due to humans seeing animals as helpless and defenseless, so we âhaveâ to help them. In reality, animals have been functioning on their own for a long time, most of the situations theyâre being catapulted into is from human activity. On the other hand, people are desensitized to people. We laugh at one anotherâs misfortune, make crude jokes, and speak the most corrosive of comments to one another. If itâs an animal, we feel a rush of pity and empathy in comparison to that of a person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       " 74521    Humans feel a responsibility to protect and domesticate animals.  This feeling, that almost forces us to help the inferior spiecies, stems from our built in system of social Darwinism.  For this reason people are more empathetic towards the helpless animal over a human who made a mistake.  Focusing on the welfare of animals more than the welfare of humans, is only a problem, if and only if there is a actual problem amongst humans,  Which there isn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

I believe the only way we could help animals is by leaving them alone because human activity and intervention has been a huge factor in the deaths of many animal species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       " 74527    Many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than people because they feel that the animals are defenceless. The research showing that \"40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist\"(Proulx) shows that people care more about other species. The lack of care towards the tourist proves people think the tourist should be able to take care of themselves. Pets and other animals can't take care of themselves when humans interfere. If the people would leave the animals alone then most of the problems would go away. When elephants get there tusks taken off they are hurt. If people would leave them alone they would be alright which makes it the job for humans to take care of the other species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       " 74528    I agree with Kristof all the way. Because even though humans dominate in intelligence. They may have not if it weren't for the resource of other species. So I definitely do not think there is issue when people focus on conserving animals. I think the issue comes into effect when we focus on what is more appreciated. Kristof makes an example of this situation when he compares the death of Cecil the lion versus the death of Tamir Rice. It seems obvious why Cecil's death drew more attention, he was a celebrity, pretty sad. If it were an ordinary lion, we don't know whether he would have received the less or more attention.  <br/><br/>Kristof makes this conflict easier to understand when he indicates it overseas in countries where wildlife is more connected than our own. Maybe human interactions such as hunting or poaching are simply actions done in order to provide for loved ones if not just themselves. I would compare it to having to slay a farm animal to provide food for you, your family, and your pet. So we need more solutions to the humans versus animals crisis, like Dzanga Sangha. Where humans can help themselves by helping fellow species instead of killing or neglecting. Because without the actual will to want to conserve species from becoming extinct, humans will only lean to the favor of the person or animal closest to them.                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       " 74529         Animals are great. Having a pet is like having a best friend that always has your back. I love all three of my pets, but if it came to it, I would always choose to save a human from danger over my pet. A humanâs life is much more valuable than an animalâs life. Humans are able to do so much more than an animal. They can have extremely valuable input into society whereas pets merely serve as companions. This isn't to say that animals aren't important to our everyday life. Just like the article mentioned, animals keep their ecosystems going, and without an ecosystem many groups of people such as the pygmy villagers mentioned would lose both their homes and their culture. <br/><br/>     The author asked an interesting question, âIs it wrongheaded to fight for elephants and rhinos (or farm animals at home) while  five million children still die each year before the age of 5?â yes, but only for the most part. If animals are something you care deeply about you can help them alongside helping the humans in the area. The world would be so much better if everyone who cared so deeply about saving the rhinos put half of their effort into building a new school, establishing a new source of water, or even buying the $5 mosquito net the author wrote about. I agree with the authorâs point of view, but I would always prioritize human needs over the needs of animals, endangered or not. With humans suffering around the world itâs our duty to help them before we turn to the elephants and rhinos. \n",
       " 74530    It is the five million children that die each year before the age of 5, that leads to results such as â40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.â In psychology the availability heuristic is a mental shortcut people use for probability based on how easily something comes to mind; such as thinking murder is more common than deaths from diabetes because amounts news coverage. Something similar appears in this situation, those millions of child deaths lose value when people disconnect from their lives, and just group deaths into statistics. However this implies some amount of human connection with their own pets, and some sort of social break from feeling a similar closeness with other peopleâs deaths.<br/>I also agree with the articleâs point that because some animals such as the northern white rhinos are nearly extinct, the death of one is especially important other the death of one in over seven billion. As well, I see how public outcry would be important, as if we were not so outraged over poaching, then it would increase the death rates and we would have a bigger problem.<br/>The sad truth is our minds do not think in the way that each humanâs death is as important as an animal or pet. However, if we take this into consideration we can do much better of then letting a 12-year-old getting shot fly under the radar of those looking at the death of Cecil the lion.                                                                                                  \n",
       " 74531          Compromise is a huge part of life, but no one should have to choose between saving or helping the life of an animal or a human. Why canât we help both? Like the article says, âempathy is not a zero-sum gameâ. Many people donât see it this way though. According to the article, nearly 40% of people would save a dog rather than another human. I think that this is due to the fact that we are so surrounded by the violence of humans towards one another covered in the news that we have become numb to it. People are naturally going to care more about animals who usually do nothing but love humans and mind their own business, rather than humans who have been shown as nothing other than violent, warring creatures.<br/>\\tBack to my original point, though, we should not have to choose between helping humans and helping animals. First off, there is not reason that we cannot help both, itâs not like humans donât have enough resources already. Secondly, Mr. Kristoff states that, in Dzanga Sangha, there is a wildlife protected area, where, as well as providing a safe place for the animals to live, the wildlife protection allows jobs and a safe place for the BaAka Pygmies. This goes to show that it is possible to help humans and animals at the same time. We can, and should, help humans as well as the animals. Neither should be viewed as less important, when our survival goes hand in hand.                                                                                                           \n",
       " 74532    Focusing on the protection of animals is a fair argument because they support a specific role in their ecosystem. These ecosystems also impact how humans can live across these continents. Not to mention, we are the reason why these animals started going extinct: white rhinos, elephants, tigers. The focus on stopping poachers from hunting these giants can help prevent the supply and demand of valuable weapons and drugs. It doesn't need to a black and white question, because the two areas can overlap when it comes into our economy and landscapes. They deserve a fair amount of protection since they haven't developed the same intelligence as humans, but in our current status of government, I'm more worried for our future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       " 74535    People seem to be empathetic towards animals until it affects themselves. People definitely seem to care about animals more than they do suffering humans. <br/><br/>Animals are seen as not having a voice, which is true. Animals can only express themselves through actions. Some view this as helplessness, much like see handicapped, the elderly, and babies. We look down on them without realizing it. People use the same high pitched patronizing voice when they're talking to a child as they do when they talk to a puppy. <br/><br/>Ironically, the people that \"care\" more about animals than humans, are the usually the same ones that support the meat industry. Why can we decide to kill animals for our own enjoyment, but when the killer hurts a pet in a movie everybody suddenly cares? If you're going to claim to care more about animals than humans, you care about all of them.<br/>I don't care more about an animal's life more than I do a human's. They are both equally valuable, but not equally important in society. If I see a roach indoors, I'm going to kill it because it's unsanitary, etc... but if I have a sick person near me and I killed them what would you say? Would you feel bad for the roach or the human? Obviously the human, but what if it was a rabid dog near me and I killed it? Then who would you feel bad for? Why is it that we claim to care about animals but only care about the ones that are cute, or provide something for us whether it be, aesthetics, a service, entertainment, etc.. ?           \n",
       " 74536    Personally I care more about the well being of my fellow humans than animals, humans are the people that share the same mental and physical structure as me. It kills me to see people suffer. Being a human I know the pain and discomfort of sufferin, so when I see someone suffering I can almost feel their pain. This emotion motivates me to help people as much as i can. However I also love and care for animals, just not as much as I care about people. There is nothing wrong with caring about animals, they are beautiful creatures! Although there is something wrong with choosing an animals wellbeing over a persons. According to this NYT article a study found that, âresearch subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beatenâ. I think that most people focus on the welfare of animals because of how cute they are, the tug on our emotions. How could you not care about the welfare of a cute little puppy, or the gentle giants elephants. Another reason I think people choose animals over people is that our society is oblivious to all the people suffering across the world. There are so many people suffering, and it breaks my heart. We need to get our act together. Put it this way, would you rather come together as a society and fight the evils of cancer or come together to stop poaching in Africa. After some deep thought I realized our human race is strong enough to do both, on the other hand we need to keep our priorities straight.                    \n",
       " 74537    I have stated on multiple occasions that I prefer dogs to humans. A person could die in a movie, and Iâll be fine, but as soon as the dog gets hurt- instant tears. I believe most people feel more sympathetic towards animals because we see them as helpless and without a voice. Whoâs going to stand up for them if we donât? And this isnât a pick-and-choose matter, we need to advocate for human suffering just as much as the mistreatment of animals.<br/>I see my pets as much of a part of my family as I am, so shouldnât the wildlife be just as much a part of our global community as humans are? In the article DieudonnÃ© KembÃ© said that whatâs good for the animals is good for the people. They add just as much to culture and society as humans do. They provide food, labor, and love. The point of charity and volunteer work is to help those less fortunate, no matter the species, so it doesnât matter if you write your check out to the animal conservatory or the childrenâs orphanage, just make sure you pick one of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       " 74538    I believe that people are right to worry about animal safety. Humans aren't the only ones on this planet, and we definitely couldn't survive if we were. We depend on animals, whether it be for food, protection, transportation, companionship, entertainment, or many more things, animals are a big part of our lives, so we need to make sure that they are all safe and alive. I also believe that people might worry about animals because they are the defenseless ones against humans and their technology, for people naturally support the underdog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       " 74539    For me, I am definitely more dedicated to helping humans, but I try to help animals in every way I can. I believe that if you help our fellow humans, there will be more people that can go out to help even more people and animals. People tend to be more empathetic toward animals because we see them as being \"helpless\" and \"innocent,\" while when we see people suffer, we tend to have that the attitude that \"they did something to deserve it\" or \"they will get over it.\" I don't think that it's wrong to focus on animal welfare. Animals have lives just like humans, and they have real emotions and pain. Not looking out for animals is just humanely wrong. People in general should devote their time to try to help both parties without harming the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       " 74540    Perhaps it's a matter of accountability. Humans consider their fellow humans on a more rigorous standard (in the light of the fact that we have similar brain circuits)âand like how a child is treated more leniently for the same offenses a more experienced adult commits, we see animals as deserving of our sympathy and care. Essentially, we're just living up to our roles as stewards of the world. <br/><br/>The issue I focus on are very human-centric: politics, human trafficking, accurate science awareness, etc. It's impossible not to care about humans; our lives are structured by the broader context of values like love and honesty, that other peopleânot necessarily animalsâhold in regard. But we often forget how important animal welfare is for human welfare. Consider Mr. Kristof's point that \"[when] the animals are gone, economic prospects for humans diminish as well\".  The vital roles that bees and bats play as pollinators in our agrarian society and the emotional support that pets bring to us, as well as the wealth of engineering inspirations found in proteins and evolution, are all ways that general human life hinges on animal survival and well-being. <br/><br/>We can't forget about the issues humanity faceâand too many serious and undeniably human problems are not being addressedâbut we can realize that animal welfare is, in many cases, an extension of human welfare.                                                                                                                      \n",
       " 74541    I agree when it comes to the part about keeping humans in our minds as well as animals. Although in your case you state the complete opposite. Many don't forget about other humans, as we see them 24.7. In the article it states, \"40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\" This is true for many people because dogs don't have a say or action to take part in. As you stated about humans not speaking up for themselves, is a perfectly true statement but that doesn't mean just forget about animals. In  the end I think we need to care about both the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
